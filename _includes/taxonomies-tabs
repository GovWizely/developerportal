		The ITA Taxonomies API gives developers direct access to the exporting, trade, and investment terms that ITA uses to tag the content and data in its other APIs.  Currently, ITA has three taxonomies:  Geographic Regions, Industries, and Topics.  This API includes all terms in their proper hierarchy in the relevant taxonomy.
		</p>
		<p>
		ITA imports data for its other APIs from many sources.  If the source data is already tagged, ITA imports those tags along with the data, maps the tags to ITAâ€™s taxonomies and publishes both the original tags and the ITA tags with the data in the API.
		</p>
		<p>The output format for this API is JSON.  This data set is updated weekly.  Test the API using the <a href="http://internationaltradeadministration.github.io/explorer/#/ita-taxonomies">demo search app</a>. Be sure to <a href="http://api.trade.gov/">sign up for an API key</a> to get access to the API.</p>

		Having an established taxonomy enables developers to quickly search for particular content and data.  ITA tags content and data at the lowest, reasonable level of detail.  ITA reviews and upgrades its taxonomies on a regular basis to ensure it reflects the content and data accurately.  As such, developers can be assured that when they perform a query on a particular term they will receive only the results that are relevant to that term.

		Use this API to populate drop downs, picklists, or a faceted navigation in your software.  You can also use this API to populate your own trade terms.
